**What is AI?**

Software that imitates human behaviours and capabilities.

Eg.

- Machine learning

  Often the foundation for an AI system, is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.

  Eg.

  1. A collection of flowers
  2. Label the flower with the right name
  3. Give the data to the computer to process by using the algorithm to find relationships between the features of the flower and the labelled name
  4. The results of the algorithm are encapsulated in a model
  5. Given the computer a random flower so the computer can identify the right name for the flower based on the trainning model.

- Computer vision

  To interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images.

- Natural language processing

  To interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.

- Document intelligence

  Deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents.

- Knowledge mining

  Extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

- Generative AI

  Create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more.



**Challenges and risks with AI**

- Bias can affect the results

- Errors may cause harm

  Automotive driving or self-driving cars

- Data could be exposed

  Training data might get leaked 

- Solutions may not work for everyone

  Home automation assistant provides no help for blind people

- Users must trust a complex system

  The AI system predicts investment, how should we trust this prediction? Where does this prediction come from and what data supports this prediction?

- Who's liable for AI-driven decisions?

  Facial recognition is wrong with innocent people. Others used his face for a crime.



**Microsoft Six AI software development principles**

- Fairness
- Reliability and safety
- Privacy and security
- Inclusiveness包容
- Transparency
- Accountability负责
